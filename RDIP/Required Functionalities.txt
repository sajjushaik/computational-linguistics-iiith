The functionalities required to run the experiment are:

    1. Based on the selection of language from the created drop-down list, we have to display the buttons of words of a sentence in a shuffled way.

    2. Each time a button is clicked, we have to display the corresponding words typed in the sequence.

    3. When the user starts opting out the words, a button must be displayed which can return to step 1 whenever the user wants to re-form the sentence. This involves 
    erasing the sentence and again display the words in random order.

    4. After using up all the words, display the button to check whether the sentence is correct or not. If correct, Display 'Right Answer', otherwise display 
    'Wrong Answer' and display the button to show the correct answers that are possible out of the given words.

    5. A function to generate a random sentence from the available sentences.


Extra functionalities that could be added are:

    1. A button to move to the next question can be added instead of refreshing the page to get a new one.

    2. Instead of showing the correct answer after a wrong attempt, only a hint could be given.
